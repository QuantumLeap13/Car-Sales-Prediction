## Usage

To use the Car Purchasing Prediction Model, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
## Data

The dataset used in this project is `car_purchasing.csv`, which contains information about customers and their corresponding car purchase amounts. This dataset is essential for training the predictive model.

### Dataset Overview
- **File Name**: `car_purchasing.csv`
- **Number of Records**: [Insert number of records, e.g., 1000]
- **Number of Features**: [Insert number of features, e.g., 9]

### Features
The dataset includes the following columns:
Column Name

Description

customer name

Name of the customer (not used in the model)

customer e-mail

Email of the customer (not used in the model)

country

Country of the customer

gender

Gender of the customer (0 for Female, 1 for Male)

age

Age of the customer

annual Salary

Annual salary of the customer

credit card debt

Credit card debt of the customer

net worth

Net worth of the customer

car purchase amount

Amount spent on the car (target variable)
## Evaluation

The performance of the car purchasing prediction model is evaluated using several key metrics that provide insights into the model's accuracy and reliability. The following metrics are used:

### 1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- **Definition**: MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It is calculated as the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
- **Formula**: 
  \[
  \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i|
  \]
- **Interpretation**: A lower MAE indicates better model performance, as it signifies that the predictions are closer to the actual values.

### 2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **Definition**: MSE measures the average of the squares of the errors—that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value. It gives a higher weight to larger errors.
- **Formula**: 
  \[
  \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
  \]
- **Interpretation**: Like MAE, a lower MSE indicates better model performance. However, because it squares the errors, it is more sensitive to outliers.

### 3. R-squared (R²)
- **Definition**: R² is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model.
- **Formula**: 
  \[
  R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{SS}_{\text{res}}}{\text{SS}_{\text{tot}}}
  \]
  where \(\text{SS}_{\text{res}}\) is the sum of squares of residuals and \(\text{SS}_{\text{tot}}\) is the total sum of squares.
- **Interpretation**: R² values range from 0 to 1, where a value closer to 1 indicates that a greater proportion of variance is explained by the model, suggesting a better fit.

### Model Performance Results
After training and evaluating the model, the following results were obtained:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 1639.49
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 5533722.74
- **R-squared (R²)**: 0.9487

These results indicate that the model performs well, with a high R² value suggesting that it explains a significant portion of the variance in car purchase amounts.

### Conclusion
The evaluation metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance. Continuous monitoring and evaluation are essential for improving the model and ensuring its reliability in real-world applications.
